  </div>
  <p class='sys_info'> Also used to elect a single candidate per electoral district, this system is often called preferential voting. OnÂ the ballot, voters rank the candidates running in their electoral district.
  Candidates garner a majority on the first count, the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes (lowest-ranked) is dropped, and the second-preference votes on the ballots where that candidate ranked first are assigned to the respective remaining candidates. This process continues until one candidate receives the necessary majority. </p>
  <p class='sys_info'>
  Drag any number of candidates from the list on the left and rank them in the space on the right with your most preferred candidate being on top</p>
